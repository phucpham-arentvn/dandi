# Active Context

## Current Focus

The project is in its initial setup phase, focusing on:

1. Establishing the core project structure
2. Setting up development tools and configurations
3. Implementing basic application architecture
4. Creating documentation and development guidelines

## Recent Changes

1. Project Initialization

   - Created Next.js project with TypeScript
   - Set up ESLint configuration
   - Configured TailwindCSS
   - Added TypeScript configuration

2. Documentation
   - Created Memory Bank structure
   - Documented project architecture
   - Established development patterns
   - Set up technical guidelines

## Active Decisions

1. Architecture

   - Using Next.js App Router for routing
   - Implementing Server Components by default
   - Following TypeScript strict mode
   - Using TailwindCSS for styling

2. Development
   - Using Turbopack for development
   - Following modular component design
   - Implementing strict type checking
   - Following accessibility guidelines

## Current Patterns
