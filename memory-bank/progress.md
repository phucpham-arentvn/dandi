   - TypeScript integration done
   - Initial configuration set
   - Development tools configured

2. Documentation
   - Memory Bank initialized
   - Project structure documented
   - Technical decisions recorded
   - Development patterns established

## Project Evolution

1. Initial Setup (Current)

   - Project bootstrapped
   - Basic configuration
   - Documentation started
   - Development environment ready

2. Next Phase

   - Infrastructure expansion

## Known Issues

1. Setup Phase

   - Basic structure only
   - Missing components
   - Incomplete documentation
   - Limited functionality

2. Technical Considerations
   - Performance optimization needed
   - Security measures pending
   - Testing coverage missing
   - Documentation gaps

## Decision History

1. Technical Choices

   - Next.js for framework
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - ESLint for code quality

2. Architecture Decisions
   - App Router architecture
   - Server-first approach
   - Modular component design
   - Type-safe implementation

## Upcoming Milestones

1. Short-term Goals

   - Complete base setup
